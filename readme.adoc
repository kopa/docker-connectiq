= docker-connectiq

Docker container with Garmin Connect IQ SDK Manager + Eclipse IDE with
respective plugins.

Based on link:https://github.com/kalemena/docker-connectiq[]. I updated the
container for the new Garmin SDK Manager, new Eclipse, and adjusted a few
things to my liking.

== Usage

=== Docker Image Build

====
    $ make build
====

=== Docker Image Run

Pass your workspace directory to the run script:

====
    $ ./run.bash WORKSPACE
====

First, run `sdkmanager` to setup SDKs and Devices. The SDK Manager stores its
files in */home/developer/.Garmin*, in case you need the SDK commands.
Afterwards, start Eclipse with `eclipse` and create a developer key (explained
link:https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/connect-iq-basics/getting-started/[here]).

[TIP]
====
For persistence reasons, any file or created project should be done in
*/home/developer/workspace* (mapped to dir that was supplied via `WORKSPACE`
arg on host) or */home/developer/.Garmin* (mapped to `~/.Garmin` on host).
====

=== Upload to Watch

====
* On Ubuntu OS
* Connect the watch using original cable
* Wait for about 30s
* Watch screen should show it is mounted and charging
* In File explorer, see *GARMIN* device and browse to *GARMIN/APPS*
* Copy *PRG* file built into this folder
* Unmount *GARMIN* icon on watch
* Watch should be showing *Verifying Connect IQ Apps*
* Swipe up or down, the app should be visible
